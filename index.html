		<h1><b>What happened to the dinosaurs?</b></h1>
		<p> <br/>  Welocme! I'm glad your here to see my brand new website, where we are going to talk about what happened to the dinosaurs.</p>
		<h2><b> Where did the dinosaurs go?</b></h2>
		<p2>Many people believe that dinosaurs were killed by a massive meteor that hit the earth. Logical? Maybe, maybe not.

		<p> Obviously this did not happen, there was not an artillery shell on Noah's ark that blasted the dinosaurs out of the water, but if that technology was avaliable, possibly? We all know that that kind of technology was not achieved then, so what happened because obviously there are no dinosaurs here. Well another possible choice would be that they were hunted into extinction. That is definitly a possible answer, as well as a logical explination. The Dodo Bird was hunted into extinction in the 16th century, the last accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662. The dodo is just one example of many species that have sadly gone extinct due to human interaction.... So much for a first impression. </p> 
<h3><b> Was Size A Contributer?</b></h3>
        <p> Size is probably the biggest factor in the dissaperence in the dinosaurs the herbivores had to eat hundreds of pounds of food each day, to stay alive. they had to migrate quite often because of this. if they stayed in one spot they would consume the entire forest, just because the trees could produce enough food fast enough for these massive creatures. Carnivores ate these massive plant eaters, and evantually the herd of herbivores would slowly fade away. The herbivores could not produce a new baby every week, but the carnivores couold eat several of them every week depending on the size of the dinosaurus and whether or not it is in a pack. Eventually food would run out for these creatures, and they could no longer eat, and they would die. Now there were smaller dinosaurs that did not make it, so where did they go? Well those smaller dinos did make it, like turtles, small birds. They did not require so much food to stay alive. Some of the smaller dinosaurs did not make it because they depended on the larger dinosaurs' eggs. so when they did not make it, the smaller dinosaurs could no longer eat the eggs, and died off. Some, like snakes, changes. They also ate other animals like rodents, or other snakes. Not just eggs. </p>
		<h4><b>What if the dinosaurs are still here?</b></h4>
		<p> Maybe The dinosaurs are on an island in the middle of nowhere, and we have just have not found it... sounds like a great theme / plot for a movie.</p>

		<p> Maybe we just have not found them yet, maybe they really are hiding out on an island. so.... go out and explore!</p>
